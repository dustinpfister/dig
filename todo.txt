2.12.x - Drop down, and pebble gain Animations.

    * added a drop down animation when dropping down to a lower layer.
    * added a pebble gain icon animation when the player bursts a tile that has pebble
    * pebble amount gained next to pebble icon when pebble gain animation happens.
    * drop down animation zooms in to the tile that the player dropped down into rather than the center each time
    * a zoom layer is used to zoom out the previous layer.


    todo:
    * new tile map zooms in as the old one zooms out
    * alpha effect with old tile map zooming out and new one zooming in.




    maybes:
    * more than one effect
    * can set which effect, as well as disable the effect in egg.js.

IDEAS:

    MISC:

        * add a logo state that displays my animated logo.
        * DIG.over state triggered if you collect all pebble in the bottom layer.
        * DIG.over state displays the reason why the game ended. 


    ANIMATIONS: 

        * add a animated logo state
        * have an animated title screen.
        * pebble collect animation.
        * Drop down transition animation
        * state change animations

    Upgrades Menu:

        * Increase max digs
        * Increase damage per dig

    Land Menu:

        * Added a land Menu that can be used to choose where to dig, as well as buy new places to dig.
        * Unlocks higher level dig sites which have:
        * More Pebble (money)
        * More layers (You Can go deeper)
        * Harder rocks to break thew to go deeper

    Push.js

    * it would be nice to have a "push.js" tool

node push.js -s

// push.js will just do a

git status

node push.js -p "new commit"

// push.js push changes:

read file : push.json
bump push.appVersion
bump push.commitCount
write file > push.json
git add *
git commit -m "new commit"
git push
