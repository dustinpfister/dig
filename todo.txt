* setting resolution based on window.innerWidth
* added a load.js file that contains a loading state

* new logo, and tile sheet.


IDEAS:

        * add a logo state that displays my animated logo.
        * DIG.over state triggered if you collect all pebble in the bottom layer.
        * DIG.over state displays the reason why the game ended. 


    ANIMATIONS: 

        * Drop down transition animation
        * state change animations

    Upgrades Menu:

        * Increase max digs
        * Increase damage per dig

    Land Menu:

        * Added a land Menu that can be used to choose where to dig, as well as buy new places to dig.
        * Unlocks higher level dig sites which have:
        * More Pebble (money)
        * More layers (You Can go deeper)
        * Harder rocks to break thew to go deeper

    Push.js

    * it would be nice to have a "push.js" tool

node push.js -s

// push.js will just do a

git status

node push.js -p "new commit"

// push.js push changes:

read file : push.json
bump push.appVersion
bump push.commitCount
write file > push.json
git add *
git commit -m "new commit"
git push
