2.14.x - node.js, and pre-commit scripts

    * started using node.js
    * made a script that bumps the version number on each commit
    * displaying current version number in the title screen by getting the package.json data

    what else?
    * scripts to run before $ git add *:
        * use js-beautify to beautify js dev files
        * use js-beautify to automatically make min versions of js files
        * have it so index.html uses the min files.
        * maybe jslint?


2.x.x - games modes

    * add a state.addGameMode method
    * a game mode can:
        * have one or more hide methods
        * it can treat tile hp in different ways
        * the number of stacks can be 1 to endless
        * loss or win conditions can change
        * have a level value associated with it


GAME MODES:

    * normal

        * You start out with 3 layers, and a few digs.
        * leveing up increaes the number of digs, the amount of stack pebble, and total layers.
        * uses the 'normal1' hide method.


    * stack 64

        This is a mode where you play with a fixed 64 count of layers. You also have a fixed count of digs as well which as you might have guessed is also 64. This gives you just enough digs to completely clear the first layer, or dig all the way to the bottom to only dig one out of 64 land tiles. 

        The amount of pebble in the stack however is not fixed, as you level up the amount of pebble in the stack will go up.

        * At the top layer all the tiles have pebble, but contain only 1 pebble amounts
        * The number of loot tiles drops by one for every layer you drop down
        * At the bottom layer there is just one tile with pebble.
        * the single loot tile at the bottom is the most valuable.

    * To China.

        Although not a true endless mode, for the most part it is.

        * earths diameter is 7917 miles or 12,738,453 m

        * unlimited digs
        * progress saved on each drop down
        * fixed 1 hp for each tile for first 10% of layers
        * auto dig option
        * leveling once china is reached.
        * leveling up just increases stack pebble

IDEAS:

    MISC:

        * add a logo state that displays my animated logo.
        * DIG.over state triggered if you collect all pebble in the bottom layer.
        * DIG.over state displays the reason why the game ended. 


    ANIMATIONS: 

        * add a animated logo state
        * have an animated title screen.
        * state change animations

    Upgrades Menu:

        * Increase max digs
        * Increase damage per dig

    Land Menu:

        * Added a land Menu that can be used to choose where to dig, as well as buy new places to dig.
        * Unlocks higher level dig sites which have:
        * More Pebble (money)
        * More layers (You Can go deeper)
        * Harder rocks to break thew to go deeper

    Push.js

    * it would be nice to have a "push.js" tool

node push.js -s

// push.js will just do a

git status

node push.js -p "new commit"

// push.js push changes:

read file : push.json
bump push.appVersion
bump push.commitCount
write file > push.json
git add *
git commit -m "new commit"
git push


    JSON LEVEL DESIGN?
{

   layers : 1,
   totalPebble:1000,
   lootTiles : [
   
       {z:0,x:0,y:0,points : 5},
       {z:0,x:6,y:8,points : 10}
