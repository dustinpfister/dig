# dig

Dig is a game about digging in a lot of land to gain an in game currency I call pebble. When I started thinking about the differences between lateral and linear thinking, the idea for this game started to come together, and things just started moving forward from there. the first prototype started out as a simple vanilla js game (1.x), and is now my first game that makes use of the [phaser](https://phaser.io/) game framework (2.x).

# Lateral thinking

The word lateral in it's adjective form, means to be of, at, toward, or from the side. However the way that I generally view lateral thinking is being multi-dimensional, that is thinking in all kinds of directions. Not being dogmatic to a single narrow approach, when it comes to finding a solution to a problem. Considering an array of solutions, and weighing up the pros and cons of each, and understating that each one may have a kind of value. For these reason's lateral thinking may often be considered a superior way of thinking when compared to it's counterpart know as linear (or vertical) thinking. However I would not go so far as to jump to that conclusion.

# Linear thinking (AKA Vertical thinking)

Linear is a word that means that something is arranged in or extending along a straight or nearly straight line. One way of thinking about it is picking a direction, and staying true to that single course. In many cases this way of thinking may be silly, however in some cases it makes sense, and is actually a better course of action compared to a more lateral approach. For example is it better to be a master of a single trade, or a jack of everything? I think most people would agree that it is better to be really good at a single thing, than to just have superficial knowledge of a wide range of disciplines. However be it as it may, I would not jump the gun and say that this way of thinking is superior as well.
