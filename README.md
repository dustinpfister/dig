# dig - testing branch

This is a branch I made to test some things out without making any changes to master


## bower_components removed from .gitignore

I have a copy of phaser stored in this branch.

## Problems with cdn.rawgit.com redirecting to raw.githubusercontent.com

For whatever the reason linking to an image on cdn.rawgit.com has started to redirrect to raw.githubusercontent.com, which results in 'cross-origin image' related error's. Which is to be expected as it is now a different domain.

click the link, it should go to cdn.rawgit.com, but goes to raw.githubusercontent.com
